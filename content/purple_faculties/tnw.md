## 9:00 - 17:00 Purple Pit Stop
Get yourself some purple accessories like a wristband or some purple nail polish.
You can also talk to some queer students and see how you can be supportive all year long by adjusting small things in your daily life.

## 12:30 Free lunch
Talk to other students about inclusion in your faculty and what you would like to see improved.

## 15:45 Campfire Talk
The Diversity & Inclusion team of TNW Zuid will host a campfire talk session
There will be some premade topics to talk about, for example; “My friend came out as non-binary but I’m struggling to use the right pronouns. This makes me feel ashamed when I make mistakes and therefore I sometimes get awkward in conversations".
Here you can get a deeper understanding of the impact on someone's life by talking about topics that queer people, but maybe also yourself, face in daily life.
