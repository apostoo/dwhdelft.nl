  "Purple Pit Stop - Get yourself a ‘roze koek’ and some purple accessories like a wristband or some purple nail polish. You can also talk to some queer students and see how you can be supportive all year long by adjusting small things in your daily life. Also the board room will be purple this day. <br/>
  In the afternoon, there is a purple VrijMiBo/ social drink with purple drinks and some nice snacks. "
